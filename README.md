Restaurant Review Dataset.We try to analyse the data and plot various graphs to gain
some valuable insights.We also use Natural language processing to process the
reviews given by users.We make use of technologies such as hadoop hdfs,Hive and
Spark to do the analysis and processing.We also try to find the main factors based on
